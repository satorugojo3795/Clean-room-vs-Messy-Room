# Clean-room-vs-Messy-Room

In this project I have used logistic regression to classify the images of room to tell whther the room is clean or messy
For this I downloaded the image dataset for kaggle.Each image in this dataset is in the for of a matrix of shape 128X128
I used the GridSearchCV function in order to find the best hyperparameters for my model
The model achieved an accuracy of 97%
